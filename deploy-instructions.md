## Deployment Steps

### For cPanel/Shared Hosting (Your Current Setup)

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:prod
   ```

2. **Upload files:**
   - Upload ALL contents of the `dist` folder to your `public_html` directory
   - Make sure the `.htaccess` file is uploaded (this is crucial for routing)
   - Ensure file permissions are set correctly (644 for files, 755 for directories)

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Visit your domain
   - Test all navigation links
   - Test the donate button specifically
   - Test browser back/forward buttons

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 404 Errors on Route Navigation
**Problem:** Getting 404 when clicking donate button or using browser back button
**Solution:** The `.htaccess` file I created will fix this by redirecting all routes to index.html

#### Missing Files
**Problem:** Some assets not loading
**Solution:** Make sure you upload the entire `dist` folder contents, including the `assets` folder

#### CORS Issues
**Problem:** API calls failing
**Solution:** The app uses multiple proxy fallbacks, should work on most hosting

## Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these scenarios:

1. **Direct URL access:** Type `yourdomain.com/donate` directly in browser
2. **Navigation:** Click all menu items
3. **Browser navigation:** Use back/forward buttons
4. **Mobile responsiveness:** Test on mobile devices
5. **Form functionality:** Test the validator and generator tools

## Performance Optimization

The build includes:
- Code splitting for faster loading
- Minified CSS and JavaScript
- Optimized images
- Gzip compression
- Browser caching headers

## Security Considerations

- HTTPS is recommended (most hosting providers offer free SSL)
- The `.htaccess` file includes security headers
- No sensitive data is exposed in the frontend
